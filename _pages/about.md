About Me
======
---

I'm a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, working under the supervision of [Hanghang Tong](http://tonghanghang.org/). Prior to this, I earned my bachelorâ€™s degree from the University of Michigan. My main research lie broadly in large language models (LLMs), particularly developing **the science of Language Models** and enhancing their **reasoning** abilities. My current research interest is **reasoning LLM**, **RL**, and **alignment**.
